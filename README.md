## Parts
### a) Long video summarization and medium article writing with gemini largest experimental model
- pick a large state of art ai related tech  video (minimum few hours  > 2 hours) - which is conference talk or something done within the last 2 months which is cutting edge ai discussion /coference or talk

- artifact - transcript and demo video of what you did - show case

### b) Claude Dev - install and pick latest claude dev extension 
- watch few videos and pick one you like most - try to install reproduce and record the final video process - it should be complex task (see echohive channel in youtube etc.,.) and should use claude 3.5 sonnet extension. you should demonstrate - it can be webapp, mobile app or anything end2end
- artifact - demo video of what you did along with code you did 

### c) Multimodal capabilities of gemini , claude and gpt4o  
- video audio and images and text
- demonstrate with colab ten advanced features of ten domains like coding, videos, images, etc.,. 
- artifact - colab with a demo video of what you did 

### d) Showcase 10 very novel usecases of long context of gemini by actually demoing and writign medium article (With help of gemini) of these.
- artifact - colab with a demo video of what you did 

### e) Do a VC pitch related all artifacts using claude 3.5  of a novel startup project (check my video of how i do it)
