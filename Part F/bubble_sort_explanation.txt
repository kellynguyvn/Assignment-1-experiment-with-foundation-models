Bubble Sort Algorithm Explanation

The following Python code implements the bubble sort algorithm:

def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

Here's how it works:

1. The function `bubble_sort` takes an array `arr` as input.

2. `n = len(arr)` gets the length of the array.

3. The outer loop `for i in range(n):` runs `n` times, where `n` is the length of the array. This ensures that we make enough passes through the array to sort all elements.

4. The inner loop `for j in range(0, n-i-1):` is responsible for comparing adjacent elements:
   - It runs from 0 to `n-i-1` because:
     a) In each iteration of the outer loop, the largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end.
     b) So, we don't need to check the last `i` elements in subsequent passes.

5. The condition `if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:` compares adjacent elements.

6. If the element at index `j` is greater than the element at index `j+1`, they are swapped:
   `arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]`
   This is Python's concise way of swapping two values.

The algorithm gets its name "bubble sort" because larger elements "bubble up" to their correct positions at the end of the array in each pass.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of elements.
Space Complexity: O(1) as it sorts in-place.

Bubble sort is not efficient for large datasets but is simple to understand and implement, making it useful for educational purposes or for sorting very small arrays.
