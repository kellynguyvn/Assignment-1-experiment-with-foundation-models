# Code Review: Factorial Function

## Original Code

```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n.

    The factorial of n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers
    less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

    Args:
        n (int): A non-negative integer for which to calculate the factorial.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of n.

    Raises:
        RecursionError: If n is too large, causing maximum recursion depth to be exceeded.
        ValueError: If n is negative.

    Examples:
        >>> factorial(5)
        120
        >>> factorial(0)
        1
        >>> factorial(10)
        3628800

    Note:
        This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial.
        For very large values of n, consider using an iterative approach
        or math.factorial() to avoid recursion depth issues.
    """
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(factorial(5))  # Should print 120
    print(factorial(0))  # Should print 1
    try:
        print(factorial(-1))  # Should raise ValueError
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    try:
        print(factorial(1000))  # May raise RecursionError
    except RecursionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Review and Suggestions

### 1. Code Correctness
- The implementation is mathematically correct and calculates the factorial as expected.
- The base cases (n = 0 and n = 1) are handled correctly.
- The recursive step (n * factorial(n-1)) is implemented properly.

### 2. Efficiency
- **Issue**: The current implementation uses recursion, which can lead to a `RecursionError` for large inputs due to Python's recursion limit.
- **Suggestion**: Implement an iterative version of the factorial function to handle larger inputs more efficiently and avoid recursion depth issues.

### 3. Readability
- The code is generally readable with clear variable names and structure.
- The docstring provides comprehensive information about the function's behavior, parameters, return value, and potential exceptions.

### 4. Best Practices
- The code follows many Python best practices, such as using docstrings and type checking.
- **Suggestion**: Consider using Python's built-in `math.factorial()` function for production use, as it's likely more optimized and can handle larger inputs.

### 5. Error Handling
- The code handles negative inputs and non-integer inputs well by raising appropriate exceptions.
- **Suggestion**: Add a check for large inputs to prevent `RecursionError` before it occurs. This could be done by setting an arbitrary upper limit for the input value.

### 6. Documentation
- The docstring is comprehensive and follows good practices.
- It includes a clear description, parameters, return value, raised exceptions, examples, and additional notes.

## Improved Version

Here's an improved version of the code addressing the points mentioned above:

```python
import math

def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n.

    The factorial of n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers
    less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

    Args:
        n (int): A non-negative integer for which to calculate the factorial.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of n.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If n is not an integer.
        ValueError: If n is negative or too large.

    Examples:
        >>> factorial(5)
        120
        >>> factorial(0)
        1
        >>> factorial(10)
        3628800

    Note:
        This function uses Python's built-in math.factorial() function for efficiency.
        For very large values of n, it will raise a ValueError to prevent
        excessive computation time or memory usage.
    """
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    if n > 100000:  # Arbitrary limit, adjust as needed
        raise ValueError("Input is too large to compute factorial efficiently")
    
    return math.factorial(n)  # Using built-in function for efficiency

def factorial_iterative(n):
    """
    Calculate factorial using an iterative approach.
    This function is provided for educational purposes.
    """
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    if n > 100000:  # Arbitrary limit, adjust as needed
        raise ValueError("Input is too large to compute factorial efficiently")
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(factorial(5))  # Should print 120
    print(factorial(0))  # Should print 1
    print(factorial_iterative(5))  # Should print 120
    try:
        print(factorial(-1))  # Should raise ValueError
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    try:
        print(factorial(1000000))  # Should raise ValueError
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Key Improvements

1. Used `math.factorial()` for efficiency in the main function.
2. Added an iterative version (`factorial_iterative`) for educational purposes and to demonstrate an alternative approach.
3. Implemented a check for large inputs to prevent excessive computation.
4. Updated the docstring to reflect the changes.
5. Modified the example usage to demonstrate the new features.

These changes make the code more robust, efficient, and suitable for a wider range of inputs while maintaining readability and educational value.

## Conclusion

The original implementation of the factorial function was generally correct and well-documented. However, it had limitations in terms of efficiency and handling very large inputs. The improved version addresses these issues by utilizing Python's built-in `math.factorial()` function, providing an iterative alternative, and adding safeguards against excessively large inputs. These changes result in a more robust and versatile implementation of the factorial function.
